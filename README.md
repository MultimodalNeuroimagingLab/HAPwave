- Ojeda Valencia G, Gregg N, Huang H, Lundstrom B, Brinkmann B, Pal Attia T, Van Gompel J, Bernstein M, In MH, Huston J, Worrell G, Miller KJ, and Hermes D. 2023. Signatures of electrical stimulation driven network interactions in the human limbic system. _Journal of Neuroscience_ (in press).

# Task Description
Patients were resting in the hospital bed, while single pulse stimulation was performed. The stimulation had a duration of 200 microseconds, was biphasic and had an amplitude of 6mA. For subject 7 stimulation amplitude was sometimes reduced to 4mA to minimize interictal responses.

# Dataset
This data is organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure specification ([BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) version 1.12.0) and available on [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004696)

# Dependencies
This code is dependent on the following packages:
- [MatMef](https://github.com/MaxvandenBoom/matmef)
- [Vistasoft](https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft)

# How to run
In order to analyse the data, and reproduce figures from the manuscript, use the following steps:
- Analyze the data and calculate statistics: pcc_Allstats_CRP.m
- Make figure 2: pcc_fig2_allLimbicN1.m 
- Make figure 3: pcc_fig3b_singleTrials.m
- Make figure 4: pcc_fig4_sigCCEPs.m (to create panels B-E, change the stimulated and measured sites in lines 149-150)
- Make figure 5: pcc_fig5_signatureShift.m (change subject in line 92)
- Make figure 6: pcc_fig6_temporalDelay.m (change subject in line 90)
- Make figure 7: pcc_fig7a_dMRI_renderLimbic_diadem
		 pcc_fig7c_xCorrelation.m (change subject in line 84)
- Make figure 8: pcc_fig8_LDAwaveform.m
